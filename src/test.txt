// there are previous we created only two files one is package.json with the help of npm init and another is app.js file manually but when i install express then it will create a package-lock.json file and nodejs automatically this means it will create a node_modules folder with all the dependencies of express and its dependencies all this exprss js code is there in the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file is created to keep track of the versions of the dependencies and their dependencies
// whenever we install a new package of npm and there is depencies should add in the package.json and all these dependencies will be installed in the node_modules folder
//our project is dependent on express and express is dependent on some other packages and those packages are dependent on some other packages so all these dependencies are installed in the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file is created to keep track of the versions of the dependencies and their dependencies
// there is both package.json and package-lock.json file in the project difference is that package.json file is used to keep track of the dependencies of the project and package-lock.json file is used to keep track of the versions of the dependencies and their dependencies
// package.json file is used to keep track of the dependencies of the project and package-lock.json file is used to keep track of the versions of the dependencies and their dependencies
